# Develeap-Portfolio

#### Digital Planner - Overview

This simple flask application is designed to give out a pretty useful task manager with to-do list. It first requires user to register an account and log in to the profile. All the relevant files regarding the application source code can be found inside the `api/` directory.
The project itself is a part of my DevOps portfolio, which I kindly invite you to check out!

#### Usage:

Simply type `./init.sh` in your command line to start the project. Then you can access it via http://localhost. Enjoy the digitial planner!

#### Note:

Make sure to add environmental variables on your choice and save them inside a `.env` file in the project's root (`/`) folder (`.env.example` file provided as a blueprint).
