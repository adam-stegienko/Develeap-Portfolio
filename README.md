#### Digital Planner - Overview

This simple flask application is designed to give out a pretty useful task manager with to-do list. It first requires user to register an account and log in to the profile.
The project itself is a part of my DevOps portfolio, which I kindly invite you to check out!

#### Usage:

Simply type `./init.sh` in your command line to start the project. Then you can access it via http://localhost. Enjoy the digitial planner!
