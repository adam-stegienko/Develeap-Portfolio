    <h3>Application overview</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The application is built with Flask and MS SQL Server database, and it is designed to give out a useful task manager with to-do list. It first requires user to register an account and log in to the profile.</p>
    <p>The project itself is a part of my DevOps portfolio, which I kindly invite you to check out!</p>
